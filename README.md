## API Project: File Metadata Microservice for freeCodeCamp


### User stories:

> I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
> The from file input field has the “name” attribute set to “upfile”. We rely on this in testing.
> When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage:

> Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.

### Hint:

- To handle the file uploading you should use the multer npm package.
